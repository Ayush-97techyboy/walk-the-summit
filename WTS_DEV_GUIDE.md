# Walk The Summit (WTS) – Developer Guide

Hi there! I’m Swarit, the former developer at Walk The Summit (WTS).  
If you’re reading this, you're probably getting ready to contribute —awesome!

---

## 🚨 Prerequisite

**IMPORTANT:** Before diving in, make sure you're comfortable with GitHub and how version control systems (VCS) work. It’ll make your life a lot easier.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Once you’re up to speed with Git and GitHub:

1. **Request Contributor Access**  
   The WTS email is the owner of the repository—reach out there to be added as a contributor.

2. **Tag Logic** (Very Important)  
   - `REMOVER` class = **Desktop website is shown**  
   - `ANTI-REMOVER` class = **Mobile/phone version is shown**  
   Use these to control responsive behavior.

3. **Search for Key Terms**  
   - Use `Ctrl+F` to locate:
     - `"CENETERER"` – handles centering elements
     - `"glassmorphism"` – used in the CSS only

4. **Animations & External Repos**  
   - The **Donate page animation** and **horizontal scroll effects** are embedded using iframes.
   - These point to separate repos owned by me, due to GitHub’s size limitations.
   - If you need to edit those, contact me and I’ll grant you contributor access.
